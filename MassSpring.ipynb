    "### What is the equation asking for?\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to be explicit and desribe the equation: we're looking for a function whose second derivative is proportional to the negative of itself; a function that reproduces itself under second-order differentiation, up to a scaling factor. In other words, we're looking for eigenfunctions of the second-derivative operator. \n",
    "This is structurally like an eigenvalue problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Ax = \\lambda x \\quad \\to \\quad \\frac{\\text{d}^2}{\\text{d}t^2} u = -\\omega_0^2 u $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "* The operator $A$ is $\\frac{\\text{d}^2}{\\text{d}t^2}$\n",
    "* The function $x(t)$ is our unknown $u(t)$\n",
    "* The eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is $-\\omega_0^2$\n",
    "  \n",
    "The solutions to this equation are the functions that are *invariant* (up to scaling $-\\omega_0^2$) under two differentiations, that is the sine and cosine: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u = A \\cos\\omega_0t+ B \\sin\\omega_0 t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are linearly independent solutions (they're not related by some multiple), and any linear combination of these functions (with any coefficients $A$ and $B$) are also valid solutions. You can plug these in and see that they will balance out both sides of the harmonic oscillator equation. This formula for $u$ covers the entire solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The operator form\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a solution but we should rearrange a little to see some more structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u''-ku = 0 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the left hand side as having some operator $L$ that acts on $u$ such that the output is always zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Lu = \\left(\\frac{\\text{d}^2}{dt^2}-k\\right)u = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say that:\n",
    "* All functions $u$ that satisfy this equation form the *nullspace* (or kernel) of the operator $L$\n",
    "* These represent all possible behaviours that the system can exhibit when undisturbed, i.e. its **natural modes of vibration**\n",
    "\n",
    "So the general $u$ we found correspond to the kernel of the harmonic oscillator operator. Any response to this system must be in this form unless there is an external force: a term on the right hand side that sends $Lu$ to a value other than zero, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Lu = f\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This now resembles the foundational matrix linear algebra problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we must find the vector $\\mathbf{x}$, that when combined with each column of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ results in $\\mathbf{b}$. \n",
    "In different terms, $\\mathbf{b}$ is the result of a linear combination of each element in $\\mathbf{x}$ and each column of $\\mathbf{A}$ ($\\mathbf{a_0}, \\mathbf{a_1}, ..., \\mathbf{a_n}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{b} = x_0\\mathbf{a_0}  + x_1\\mathbf{a_1}  + x_2\\mathbf{a_2}  + ... +  x_n\\mathbf{a_n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that knowing the nullspace of $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back to the solution\n",
    "Now that we have a general solution, to find a unique solution we need to apply some conditions. The number of conditions corresponds to the order of the highest derivative, so in this case we need two (initial) conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(0) = u_0 \\quad u'(0)=u'_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this we can follow the natural progression of $u$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u = A \\cos(\\omega_0 t) + B \\sin(\\omega_0 t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "u'(0) = u'_0= -A\\sin0 + B \\cos 0 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have two equations for two unknowns, and the answer is: $B=u'_0$ and $A=u_0$. So, finally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u = u_0 \\cos (\\omega_0 t) + u'_0 \\sin(\\omega_0 t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If initially velocity is zero, motion is a simple cosine oscillating for all time. Imparting some initial velocity makes the motion a combination of sine and cosine (still oscillating indefinitely).\n",
    "\n",
    "### An iterative approach\n",
    "It helps to follow the progression step by step, and for this we don't even need to know the solution. The recipe for motion is already baked into the equation. Take the equation in the initial form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u'' = -\\omega^2 u\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And let's use some real values for the initial conditions: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(0) = 1 \\quad u'(0) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial velocity is zero, and the initial displacement is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we start at time zero, and work out the second derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u''(0) = -\\omega_0^2 u(0) = -\\omega_0^2 \\cdot 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the current speed is zero, $u'(0)=0$, so if we took a small step forwards in time $\\Delta t$, the position $u$ must be more or less the same. But the speed, that started at zero, is being changed by a small amount, so that it begins to go negative (due to the negative acceleration):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u'(\\Delta t) \\approx u'(0) +  u''(0)\\cdot \\Delta t = -\\omega^2 \\Delta t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the position should now begin to drop since its rate of change is negative. You can convince yourself that this makes sense physically. Displacing the mass away from equilibrium by a distance of $u(0)=1$ means it should want to accelerate towards $u=0$; the further away, the greater the acceleration. We continue to build up negative speed $u'$ as long as we are away from equilibrium $u=0$ in the positive direction. When we cross zero, we will have reached a high negative speed, meaning we don't stop, but \"overshoot\" the equilibrium position and start over again: acceleration is negative and speed will correspondingly decrease only when $u<0$, dropping until eventually we stop, switch direction and the cycle repeats in reverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we apply the instructions of this equation step by step (for instance using Euler's method) we will \"discover\" the sinusoidal motion built into the harmonic oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fourier shortcut\n",
    "\n",
    "We stick with the same equation and now switch to a different approach.\n",

    "u'' -\\omega_0^2 u = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to find solutions that satisfy the equation directly in time, we apply the Fourier transform to both sides, knowing that the time derivative will become simple scaling by a constant, as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}(u'') = -\\omega^2 \\mathcal{F}(u) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the whole equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}(u'')+\\omega_0^2 \\mathcal{F}(u) = -\\omega^2 U(\\omega) + \\omega_0^2 U(\\omega) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $U(\\omega)$ is shorthand for the Fourier transform of $u$. \n",
    "So we factor the outcome and get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2) U(\\omega) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We turned the differential equation into an algebra problem where we need to solve for $U$. We note here though that the only valid solution is either $U=0$ or $\\omega$ matches the natural frequency so that $\\omega=\\omega_0$. What does this mean? $U$ can take any value when $\\omega=\\omega_0$, but **must be zero elsewhere**. There is only one allowed frequency, $\\omega_0$. The Fourier transform has \"filtered out\" all disallowed frequencies in the system. We knew already that this is how this system wants to naturally evolve: oscillating at a single frequency, unless compelled otherwise by an external force. This is telling us, more precisely, that $U$ takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(\\omega) = A \\delta(\\omega-\\omega_0)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't a function in the regular sense, but is a distribution: the presence of $\\delta$ means this expression only makes sense inside an integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recover $u(t)$ we can use the inverse transform of $U$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A \\delta(\\omega-\\omega_0) e^{i\\omega t} \\text{d}\\omega = A e^{i\\omega_0 t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And nothing else. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's very important to note that the Fourier transform is applied over the whole time axis: there is no priviliged starting time. As such, it neither implicitly nor explicitly incorprates initial conditions, of which we need two for a second order differential equation. The system is underdetermined. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the Fourier transform to solve such problems, we are dispensing with **initial conditions and transients**. Instead, we're focusing on the **steady state** response; that is, the long-term behaviour of the system under continuous oscillatory forcing, *after* all transients have died out and all the dust has settled.\n",

We can think of $F(\\omega)$ as the input, and $U(\\omega)$ as the output, and $\\frac{1}{\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2}$ as what the system does to the input to produce the output: its response. A more general way of seeing this is:\n",
