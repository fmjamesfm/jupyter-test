    "If you can already answer the following questions you can probably skip this part:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key terms you need to understand:\n",
    "* Magnitude, phase\n",
    "* Mean square and RMS\n",
    "* Norm and inner product\n",
    "* Sound intensity\n",

    "\n",
    "Questions you should be able to answer at the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the geometrical interpretation of summing and multiplying complex numbers and why is this useful in acoustics?\n",
    "* How can you use complex numbers to determine the phase angle between two quantities? What can the phase between of sound pressure and particle velocity tell you about sound energy flow?\n",
    "* If you are given sound pressure (in Pa) at a frequency $\\omega$ as: $p(\\omega)=0.2 + 0.3i$ can you work out what the amplitude and RMS value of sound pressure at that frequency?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably dealt with complex numbers already in engineering or mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In acoustics, complex numbers are fundamental in easily dealing with oscillatory behaviour. They are so fundamental and implicit in almost every application of acoustic engineering that often you may not even notice that they are there.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will commonly find sound pressure or some other quantity $s$ expressed in this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s(\\omega, t) = A(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\omega$ an angular frequency, $t$ is time and $A$ is a complex function of frequency, which we call the complex amplitude of $s$. This is a simple object, though it implies a great number of steps and a long mathematical and physical history. You can visualise $p$ as a point in 2D space, moving along a circle of fixed radius $|A|$ centred on the origin, with angular velocity $\\omega$, completing a full rotation every period $T=2\\pi/\\omega$. Often the term $e^{i\\omega t}$ is simply assumed to apply to all quantities. This is usually the result of having transferred the problem to the frequency domain via Fourier transform, this procedure being assumed background knowledge for just about any acoustics work. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this so far seems odd and fills you with doubts, then you're in the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A real signal\n",
    "\n",
    "Real, measured values aren't complex. If some signal $s$, which could be pressure, force, displacement, or other real physical datum, oscillates over time at a single frequency $\\omega$ it has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $A$ is the amplitude of oscillation, $\\omega$ is its angular frequency, $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, with $f$ being frequency in Hz, and $\\phi$ is a fixed phase offset in radians. This function is periodic with period $T$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$T=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}=\\frac{1}{f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a convenient form to consider since we know that we can extract individual frequencies from a signal using a Fourier transform (you don't need to know the details well for now, but you can see [Fourier](Fourier.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "All values so far are purely real, and unfortunately this introduces a bit of complication when combining signals in almost any way. There's no obvious simplification for adding two signals together of this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi), \\quad v(t)= B \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta)  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "despite them having the same frequency $\\omega$. Getting ratios and products of signals is also not particularly enlightening. This is frustrating because if I add, subtract, multiply or divide two or more signals periodic every $T$ then the result should also be periodic every $T$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Averages are a little more helpful. A straight average of $s(t)$ over a period $T$ is zero, but we can extract the amplitude $A$ by the average of the square $s^2$ over a period since $A$ is time invariant, and over a full cycle the integral of $\\cos^2(x)$ is just $T/2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\langle s^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T s^2(t) =  \\frac{A^2}{T} \\int_0^T \\cos^2(\\omega t + \\phi) \\,\\text{d} t = \\frac{A^2}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The (positive) square root of this is known as the *root mean square* of $s$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{RMS}(s) = \\sqrt{\\langle s^2 \\rangle} =  \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean square of the sum of two signals would contain mixed terms (since a squaring of the sum is needed):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\langle (s+v)^2 \\rangle =  \\frac{A^2}{2} +\\frac{B^2}{2} + 2\\frac{AB}{T}\\int_0^T \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The result depends on the angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ third term on the right hand side. The total could be at most $\\frac{(A+B)^2}{2}$ but could also be 0 if $A=B$ and the two signals are 180 degrees out of phase, so that $\\phi = \\theta +n\\pi$ for some integer $n \\ne 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sound intensity \n",
    "\n",
    "We often want to know how much sound energy is being carried or transferred by acoustic waves. \n",
    "Sound intensity is a common energy measure, being the amount of sound energy flowing per unit area and per unit time at some position ($\\text{W}/\\text{m}^2$ in SI units). It tells us where sound energy is going. We'd want to know this in the context of noise reduction. Often we are really just happy with an idea of total sound energy covering a surface (for instance, how much flows in and out of some wall). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we know intensity $I$ over a surface $S$, then total sound power flowing (energy flux) through the surface is obtained by integrating intensity over that surface:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\iint\\limits_S \\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\cdot I \\text{d}S\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$ is the unit normal vector to the surface $S$. If the surface fully encloses one or more sound sources we will get the total sound power contributed by those sources. The sound power of a sound sources is commonly measured in an anechoic chamber by measuring acoustic intensity (often indirectly via sound pressure alone) along a surface all around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intensity is defined in terms of sound pressure $p$ (a scalar quantity) and the particle velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ (a vector):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = p \\mathbf{v}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are real quantities. This is close to the definition of mechanical power $P = \\mathbf{f} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ which, being a dot product of force and velocity vectors, it tells us how aligned a force is with velocity (of some object). If force and velocity are pointing in the same direction we have net work being done by the force $f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In acoustics, force arises from the spatial gradient of pressure, and we are for the most part dealing with oscillating behaviour, so pressure and velocity will oscillate and switch directions. We are still interested in how well they are aligned. If pressure and velocity are moving up and down together, it means sound energy is being transferred. If, on the other hand, pressure changes lead or lag velocity, some energy is being stored locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're not that interested in what happens at a particular point in time, rather we want to know the average intensity over a period of time $T$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle I\\rangle = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T p \\mathbf{v}dt \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We find here what looks like (and is) an average of the product $p\\mathbf{v}$, however it should be interpreted as an inner product: if pressure and velocity are orthogonal to each other over time, the net result is zero, mean intensity is zero, and there is no net flow of energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we pick some arbitrary direction, and if both pressure and velocity vary harmonically, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(t) = P \\cos (\\omega t + \\theta), \\quad v(t)=V \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then we evaluate intensity over a full cycle $T$ and end up with the inner product of two cosines for the acoustic intensity in that direction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle I \\rangle = \\frac{P V}{T}\\int_0^T \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta) \\cos (\\omega t + \\phi) dt \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If pressure and velocity are 90 degrees out of phase, then the average intensity is zero and no energy is flowing in this direction. If pressure and velocity are in phase (i.e. it $\\theta = \\phi$) then this evaluates to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle I \\rangle  = \\frac{P V}{2} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead we had represented pressure and velocity using complex phasors (resulting from a Fourier transform), mean intensity is usually shown as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I =\\frac{1}{2} \\Re(p \\overline{v})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression is a common source of confusion for three reasons:\n",
    "* There is the complex conjugate of velocity $v$\n",
    "* There is a factor of 1/2\n",
    "* Only the real part is used\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume $p$ and $v$ are in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p = P e^{i\\omega t}, \\quad v = V e^{i \\omega t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want average energy per unit time we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",

    "The real part of intensity represents \"real\" power flow through some surface, but why? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Plane waves\n",
    "\n",
    "For a plane wave travelling in the positive $x$ direction, of amplitude $A$, and angular frequency $\\omega$, at time $t$, acoustic pressure is given by:\n",

    "$$p(x,t) = A e^{i (\\omega t - kx)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase angle of this complex quantity (assuming $A$ is real) is $\\theta=\\omega t-kx$. By advancing either time $t$ or moving in the negative position $x$ we will increase the angle, and the vector representing $p$ would rotate counterclockwise. If $A$ is real it only means that the arrow is pointing along the x axis for $\\theta=\\omega t - kx = 0$. We can also separate out the time and space components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x,t) = A e^{i(\\omega t - kx)}=A e^{i\\omega t}e^{-ikx}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see total pressure $p$ as the product of separate time and space dependent parts. This form most commonly appears as a solution to separable partial differential equations (as you can see in the [Fourier notebook](Fourier.ipynb))\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at a fixed position like $x=0$, then $\\theta=\\omega t$ and phase angle is varying only with time (since frequency is given). We can easily draw the arrow $\\vec{p}$ for any given time $t$ and note that increasing $\\omega$ has the effect of making the vector rotate faster around the unit circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general solution to the one dimensional wave equation is in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x,t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\left(A e^{-ikx}+B e^{ikx}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term represents a forward (positive direction) traveling wave, while the second term a backward traveling wave.  \n",

    "\n",
    "We'll start with the absolute basics of complex numbers, and build up to how they can help us effectively deal with audio signals and wave-based solutions to acoustic problems. There are also plenty of interactive examples here to play with. \n",

    "It helps to take a geometrical view, and see $A$ as a point in 2D space: the real part $a$ is the $x$ coordinate and the imaginary part $b$ is the $y$ coordinate. \n",

    "A lot can be gleaned from this plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that $A+B$ is sometimes zero (or the *null vector* (0,0) of zero length). If we think of addition as translation, getting zero out is equivalent to moving the point $A$ back to the origin. The easiest way to get to the origin from $A$ is to follow a line pointing straight to the origin. This would be a vector $\\vec{B}$ with the same length as $\\vec{A}$ but in the opposite direction: \n",
    "\n",
    "$A=a+ib$\n",
    "\n",
    "$B=-a-ib$ \n",
    "\n",
    "so that $A+B=0 + 0i$\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's obvious what the result would be when writing out explicitly real and imaginary parts, it might not seem so clear in polar form with exponentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $A=e^{i\\theta}$, the angle of $B$ required to point in the opposite direction would be $\\theta+\\pi$ so that $B=e^{i(\\theta+\\pi)}$. This can be rewritten as $B = e^{i\\theta}\\cdot e^{i\\pi}=-e^{i\\theta}$ so that $B=-A$ and of course you get zero! Note that by multiplying $A$ with $e^{i\\pi}$ (which is the same as multiplying by $-1$) we have produced a vector in the opposite direction, or equivalently rotated $A$ by 180 degrees or $\\pi$ radians.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the sum of $A$ and $B$ is at its maximum length if they both point in the same direction or have the same angle $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By playing with the angles above we can also verify that the magnitude of the sum of $A$ and $B$ is always less than or equal to the sum of their magnitudes which is an important inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|A+B|\\leq |A| + |B|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding multiple numbers together makes it clear how translation as summation works:"

    "# Multiplication as rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that multiplication by $e^{i\\pi}$ seems to rotate a complex number by 180 degrees. Complex multiplication can be interpreted as stretching and rotating a complex number about the origin. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's not at all obvious if we tediously multiply out the real and imaginary parts directly, as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A=a+ib$\n",
    "\n",
    "$B=a'+ib'$\n",
    "\n",
    "$C=A\\cdot B=(a+ib)(a'+ib')=(aa'-bb')+i(ab'+ba')$\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of $C$ would be $|C|^2=(aa'-bb')^2+(ab'+ba')^2$. The angle of $C$ would be $\\theta=\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{ab'+ba'}{aa'-bb'}}$. Hard to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead we use the polar form things are much clearer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A=|A| e^{i\\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$B=|B| e^{i\\phi}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C=|C|e^{i\\gamma}=A\\cdot B=|A| e^{i\\theta}\\cdot |B| e^{i\\phi}=|A||B| e^{i(\\theta+\\phi)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new complex number $C$ has magnitude $|C|=|A| |B|$ and angle $\\gamma=\\theta+\\phi$ and it's immediately obvious that it is a scaled and rotated $A$ (or $B$)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Every complex number (even purely real numbers) encode an angle and so they all perform a rotation. Even one complex number on its own can be interpreted this way: \n",
    "\n",
    "take $A=1+2i$. There is a sum (translation) and a rotation (multiplication with $i$). Multiplication by $i=e^{i\\pi/2}$ is a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation! \n",
    "\n",
    "If $A$ was an instruction it would say: \"Start from the origin, move to the right by one step (1,0), then turn 90 degrees (up) and move two steps (0, 2$i$).\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a go in code, we'll fix the magnitudes of $A$ and $B$ to $=1$ so we only look at rotation."
