    "Perhaps the best approach to understanding Fourier series and transforms is to start with the original rationale. Joseph Fourier developed his revolutionary approach to solve real heat flow problems.\n",
    "These involved solving the heat equation, to find how the temperature $u$ in some material evolves over time. Here is the heat equation in one spatial dimension $x$ (to keep things simple). It can describe how temperature varies along a rod:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a diffusion equation, and the constant $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, a property of the medium. It doesn't matter too much what all of this means for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided the geometry is simple enough, you can use separation of variables to solve this partial differential equation (PDE). This means assuming that the temperature $u$ is composed of the product of two independent terms: one being purely time dependent, and one being purely space dependent:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u=X(x)\\cdot T(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If this seems like a wild guess, it's because it is. We are assuming that the temperature distribution maintains a constant shape in space, and that over time the shape is uniformly damped.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we plug this form of $u$ into the heat equation we find that we can neatly separate the time and space dependent parts on either side of the equation. This is because the time dependent parts are constants under differentiation over space, and vice-versa. So we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}=\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the prime indicates differentiation (and double prime is differentiating twice). The trick to continuing here is to think that since the left hand side cannot vary with time, the right hand side must not either! This means $T'/T$ is constant, and so is $X''/X$ and they are equal. We will name this constant  $\\lambda$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}=\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)}=\\lambda\n",
    "$$\n",
    "And now we have two equations:\n",

    "X''(x)=\\frac{\\lambda}{D} X(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T'(t)=\\lambda T(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are now ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and can be solved independently and more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the time dependence $T$. We're looking for a function $T(t)$ that, when differentiated once, returns itself times a constant. The exponential $e^{\\lambda t}$ fits the bill, and this is so by definition! $e^x$ is the function that satisfies $f(x)=f'(x)$.\n",
    "So we've found half of the solution $$u=X(x)\\cdot e^{\\lambda t}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Not bad. However, there's a little problem: $\\lambda$ can't be a positive number. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\lambda$ is positive, the temperature will increase exponentially over time, which would violate energy conservation: we're adding free energy over time into the system, when we expect it to be dissipated. $\\lambda>0$ is still mathematically valid, but not physical! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back, and to make things easier to interpret we introduce a negative sign, and assume that $\\lambda$ is a positive physical quantity. This fixes our time dependence (this also has some interesting consequences to the space dependent equation). The time dependence is now:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T'(t)=-\\lambda T(t) \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So now $T(t)=e^{-\\lambda t}$ and we're happy. Well, almost. We can see that temperature will decay exponentially over time to zero, the equilibrium temperature, but there could also be some unknown constant in the mix: $T(t)=C e^{\\lambda t}$. Not to mention that we still have no idea what $\\lambda$ is, and for this to be any use we ought to find out how quickly the temperature will decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big problem that Fourier faced comes about when looking at the spatial distribution of $X(x)$. For simplicity let's introduce another constant $k^2=\\lambda/D$. And here's our ODE for the spatial dependence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X''(x)=- k^2 X(x) \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the temperature distribution along this rod needs to be a function whose second derivative is equal to itself (times a constant). This is a property that the sine and cosine functions have, so they should work as valid values of $X(x)$. It may seem strange to jump to a solution like this, but as you may have seen by now, wild guessing is the name of the game.\n",
    "So we plug in a wild guess, $X(x) = \\sin(k x)$ and we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2 \\sin(k x)}{dx^2} = -k^2 \\sin (k x)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This works. And now $\\cos(k x)$ instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2 \\cos(k x)}{dx^2} = -k^2 \\cos (k x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This works too. The argument of cosine and sine could also have an additional constant, like $\\cos(k x + \\phi)$, since on differentiation, $\\phi$ doesn't come out of the argument of the cosine (using the chain rule): \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2\\cos(k x + \\phi)}{dx^2}=-k^2\\cos(k x + \\phi)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's still a valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat surprisingly, the exponential $e^{k x}$ doesn't work!\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2 e^{k x}}{dx^2} = {\\color{Red}+}k^2 e^{k x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign ends up wrong on the RHS. So surely flipping the sign of the exponent would? No. Plugging in $e^{-k x}$ still results in a plus sign on the RHS after double differentiation since $(-k)^2=+k^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But inserting the imaginary unit $i$ into the exponent $e^{ik x}$ (or $e^{-ik x}$) does work, as the sign will flip correctly after differentiating twice (because $i^2=-1$ of course)! \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2 e^{ik x}}{dx^2} = -k^2 e^{ik x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know (thanks to Euler's hard work) that $e^{ix}$ is a combination of a cosine (real part) and a sine (the imaginary part), so we can see why that worked. ([See the notebook on complex numbers which is best to have looked at first](Complex.ipynb))\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have some solutions, but any linear combinations of valid solutions for $X(x)$ also work, like \n",
    "\n",
    "$$X(x)=A\\sin(k x) + B\\cos(k x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have some unknown constants $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "You can try plugging this into Equation (3) and you will see it all checks out, since differentiation applies separately to each component of the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to remember that we haven't pinned down a value of $k$, since $\\lambda$ isn't known. There could be multiple valid values of $k$, and this will depend on any additional constraints we put on the system. If $k$ could only have certain discrete values, then a valid solution could end up being an infinite series, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X(x)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(A_n \\sin(k_n x) + B_n \\cos (k_n x)\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite interesting. The temperature distribution could be an infinite sum of sines and cosines. Fourier thought - without much rigorous justification - that *any* function could be represented as a sum of such harmonics. Daniel Bernoulli had previously come to a similar conclusion while tackling problems on vibrating strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed a lot of shapes are possible with just a few harmonics. Play with the code below which sums sine shapes only, and only with arguments that are integer multiples:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n \\pi}{L} x\\right)\n",

    "with $n\\in\\{1,2,3,...\\}$. This is a special case that is very important as we'll see. This function describes just as well the temperature along a rod of length $L$ as the motion of a vibrating string of length $L$. Try to see what constraints there are to the overall shape."
