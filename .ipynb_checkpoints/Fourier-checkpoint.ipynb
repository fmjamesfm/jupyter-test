    "This is a Fourier series expansion of a function $f(x)$ over the interval $[-L,L]$. Equivalently, it represents a periodic function with period $T=2L$. It expresses such function as an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions, one for each integer $n \\in \\{1,2,3,...\\}$, and each with with its own weighting constant $a_n$ and $b_n$. Looking at Eq. 1, we should see that each of the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ tells us how much of $\\cosn$ and $\\sinn$ respectively are present in $f(x)$.

    "## A little history\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to understand Fourier series (and eventually transforms) is to go back to its origins. Before Joseph Fourier came to the scene, it was already known, thanks to Daniel Bernoulli and Euler among others, that many physical problems could be approached with trigonometric series. For instance, the displacement $u$ along a vibrating string of length $L$, fixed at both ends $x=0$ and $x=L$, can be represented as an infinite sum of its natural mode shapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n \\sinn\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with mode numbers $n\\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. Whether sines or cosines or mixtures of both appear in a Fourier series depends on the boundary conditions, or equivalently, on the symmetry of the function. We'll explore that later, but perhaps you can already tell why the displacement along such a string is represented as a sum of sines only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, Fourier spent a lot of time playing with trigonometric series, expressing functions in terms like these:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)=a_0+a_1\\cos(\\pi x) + a_2\\cos(2\\pi x) + ...$ \n",
    "\n",
    "And finding that he could recover each coefficient by the inner product of $f(x)$ with $\\cos(n\\pi x)$ (here the integration interval would be $x=[-1,1]$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourier's radical leap was to suggest that *any* function (even discontinuous and not very nice ones) could be expressed as an infinite trigonometric sum with a combination of sine and cosine. This was fairly controversial at the time (and formal proof of this would come much later through Dirichlet, Riemann and others), so Fourier was subject to some criticism from his peers for lack of rigour. It was clear to everyone involved that these series and integrals were often poorly behaved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, he developed what is now called Fourier analysis, while studying heat flow, culminating in his influential book [The Analytical Theory of Heat](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/analytical-theory-of-heat/F6D4802336FABD1116DDA4AA3FE6EFAA). The modern foundations for this topic were born out of his work on the heat equation, a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how the temperature $u$ in some material evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving the heat equation \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the heat equation in one spatial dimension $x$ (to keep things simple). In one dimension it could describe how temperature $u$ varies along a rod:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n",
    "}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the diffusion equation (a *parabolic* PDE), and the constant $D$ is the diffusion coefficient (*thermal diffusivity*), a property of the medium, which tells us how quickly heat (in our case) spreads through the material. This kind of equation applies to many diffusion-type phenomena, including diffusion of sound energy (e.g. in statistical room acoustics). We won't spend too much time on the physical interpretation but rather focus on Fourier's mathematical approach. We could already discretise the problem and solve a particular situation numerically (and you can find an approach in the notebook on [Waves](Waves.ipynb)), but we will take the analytical route.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the method of *separation of variables* to solve this equation. This means assuming that the temperature $u$ is composed of the product of two independent terms: one being purely time dependent, and one being purely space dependent:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u=X(x)\\cdot T(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If this seems like a wild guess, it's because it is. It may seem needlessly restrictive, ruling out a lot of possible behaviours. But keep in mind that we're dealing with a *linear* differential equation that admits multiple (even infinite) solutions (by *superposition*). In fact (**spoiler alert**) the full solution ends up being a sum of such separable solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(x,t) = X_1(x)T_1(t) + X_2(x) T_2(t) + X_3(x)T_3(x) + ...$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "so that each shape $X_n(x)$ has its own distinct time dependence $T_n(t)$. The result is complex behaviour that can track experimental results to high degree of accuracy. Separation of variables has its limitations, as while it can work for more than one spatial dimensions, it is restricted to specific geometries (e.g. exhibiting high symmetry like rectangular, cylindrical, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we plug this form of $u=X(x)T(t)$ into the heat equation, we find that we can neatly separate the time and space dependent parts on either side of the equation.
